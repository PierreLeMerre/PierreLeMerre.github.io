            <h2>The prefrontal cortex</h2>

             <p>The PFC still lacks a conclusive definition, and the structure and function of this brain area across species remain unresolved. The PFC is implicated in perceptual, emotional, social, motivational, and numerous other brain processes and considered to enable flexible behavior. In following, disturbed PFC functioning has been connected to most, if not all, mental disorders, including drug addiction. Present-day preclinical researchers increasingly utilize mice (Mus musculus) as model animals. However, in parallel clinical transfer of pre-clinically identified therapeutics targeting mental disorder (and other brain disorders) is still at large failing. Lack of understanding of the structure and function of the brain hampers the understanding of which findings are transferable between species. Needless to say, deciphering of the structure and function of the PFC is of great importance to medicine. While class-common functions and class-common behaviors have been firmly established, effort must also be put into clarifying dissociations, and perhaps most so between primates and rodents. Ultimately, understanding of what makes the human PFC unique will build on comparative studies in different species.</p>
